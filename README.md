# The-Maze-of-Waze
The project deals with intentional graphs.
We built 5 departments:  node, edge, DGraph, Graph_Algo, gui_graph.
node - A class that represents the vertices of the graph. And this class implements the interface node_data.
edge - A class that represents the graph edges. And this class implements the interface edge_data.
DGraph -   A class that implements interface graph. In class Dgraph we did functions such as:getNode,getEdge,addNode,removeNode...
Graph_Algo -  A class that implements interface graph_algorithms.In class Graph_Algo we did functions such as:init,save,isConnected...
gui_graph - A class that draws the graph.
